# Welcome!

Welcome to Condor's Assessment challenges!

Please fork the repo to start. Once finished, issue a pull request to our repo so we can review your solution.

All of the challenges require:

- NodeJS `>= v18`
- NPM
- TS skills
- A cup of ‚òï or üçµ

Each assessment is pre-configured, so just running `npm i` should install these basic packages:

- React Router + Axios: To fetch data and navigate through the site.
- Parcel + React.js: To serve and build a simple front-end.
- Typescript: To build our app.
- Json Server: To serve and expose a basic json db.

In the main `package.json` you'll have access to the following scripts:

- `npm run start` or `npm run start [folder-name]`: To run an assesstement test. You'll have to provide the name of the assessment's folder as a command argument, otherwise you'll be prompted for it. If none is provided the command will fail.
- `npm run server`: To start a local db for some tests.
- `npm run clean`: Remove ignored folders.
- `npm run reset`: Clean and install anew.

## Submission Guidelines

You may use any other package of your choice to enrich your development experience, but please read your assigned assessment test's README.md as it will have extra instructions.

Once finished, issue a pull request to our repo's main branch so we can review your solution.
